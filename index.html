    Why Marketing Is A Profit Center
This is what happens when a sales guy writes an article about marketing. And why wouldn't I? Marketing is
good to me, it's working while I'm selling and also when I'm not. We make a good team.
Half of our leads this year will probably come from our marketing efforts, the rest will arrive from a mix of
business development efforts and some partner and referral leads.
It all starts with a solid Go-To-Market strategy, researched and documented by experts in our market. This
foundation establishes the messaging delivered by everyone and everything in our organization from that point
forward.
But maybe you're not coming from it at that angle. Maybe you're churning on the number of contracts you need
signed this fiscal year:
Let's say we need to make $10,000,000 in sales. (<--feel free to change this total)
And our typical sale is $200,000.
That means we need to get 50 contracts signed.
As we've said, 50% of those contracts will likely come from our marketing efforts. This is where Ad Spend
budgeting comes in, that difficult to pin-down sort of number that has too many zeros. Is there any rhyme or
reason behind this number? Yes! Let's walk through it.
Half or 25 contracts will come from qualified leads responding to our marketing efforts. This is called an
inbound lead. It refers to a new business connection to your company who needs your products and services.
About 10% of our qualified leads will sign a contract, meaning that we'll need 250 qualified leads to gain $5MM
in revenue.
Qualified leads are a subset, let's start with 30% of all leads, meaning that our goal is to gain 250/0.3 or about
830 leads.
In the digital space (LinkedIn, Google Ads, our Website, etc), a lead happens when an interested person clicks
on an ad or downloads an article, or writes or calls the company in response to something they see or hear.
Properly placed ads and articles that make the new connection easy are referred to as implementing a
Call-To-Action (CTA).
To react to something that represents your company, products, or services, this person has to see it or hear
about it. These are called views or impressions of our ad, post, article, podcast, etc. The rate at which people
who view an ad and click on it to learn more is typically around 1.5%.
We're now at 830/0.015 which is about 55,300 views or impressions that we need to gain these leads. This is
referred to as traffic.
If this was all ads at a cost per click of $5, our budget would be 830 x 5 or $4,150. (This seems like a low
number to generate $5MM in business)
    Metrics
The right way to manage this process is exactly to do that: manage it! To manage Ad spend as well as all of
the other components in our marketing plan is best accomplished by collecting and analyzing the data behind
our marketing activities.
Here are a few metrics that weigh into our ad spend decision-making.
Cost per Lead -
Cost per Sale -
